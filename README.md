- A white bird drifting alone.

- Blending neither into the blue of the sky nor the blue of the sea.

- Flying on the white wings to the tropical island between the two blue worlds.

- We've always fooled around together since we were kids.

- We've shared the most exciting moments, but every story has an end.

- No one can stay a kid forever.

- Time moves on, and people grow up.

- We must go our separate ways.

- You must keep going even after I'm gone.
